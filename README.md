# PhoneNum_Email_Extractor
Say you have the boring task of finding every phone number and email address in a long web page or document.
If you manually scroll through the page, you might end up searching for a long time. But if you had a program that could search the text in your clipboard for phone numbers and email addresses, you could simply press ctrl-A to select all the text, press ctrl-C to copy it to the clipboard, and then run your program.
It could replace the text on the clipboard with just the phone numbers and email addresses it finds. 
Well, that is exactly what PhoneNum_Email_Extractor does, you just have to copy some text to your clipboard and then run the program, you will now have in your clipboard all the Phone Numbers and Emails that the program could detect. 

note: it may not extract all Phone Numbers because this program was meant to be for Argentine Phone Numbers, so, you may have some problems extracting numbers that are not from Argentina, nonetheless i´m sure that you will get something of it anyway.
